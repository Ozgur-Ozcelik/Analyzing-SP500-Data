# Project-2
Analyzing New York Stock Exchange S&amp;P 500 Data

In this project I have used data set provided from Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.
The main goal of this project is for me to demonstrate my ability to:

• Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)

• Use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data 
validation, VLOOKUP).

• Analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.

• Create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.
